## TECH ANSWERS
#### How long did you spend on the coding test? What would you add to your solution if you had more time? If you didn't spend much time on the coding test then use this as an opportunity to explain what you would add.
- I took approximately 1 week from the time I received the exercise to submit it. Some of the features I could have added include local storage to enable the data to persist for the session. At the moment, the items that render onload, are hardcoded. I could also have added the functionality for editing a todo. 

### Which parts did you spend the most time with? What did you find most difficult?
- I struggled with the testing bit of the app. I did not figure out how to test my methods eg. To add and delete the todos. However, I was able to do the snapshot tests. I was also unable to figure out the drag and drop functionality. 

#### What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of Vue.js? Please include a snippet of code that shows how you've used it. 
n/a

#### How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever had to do this?
- I have never tracked perfomance issues in Production. However I keep a preview deployment branch that is a duplicate of the deployed main branch. That way, if i add a new feature and it fails, I will not merge the branch to the main branch. 

#### How did you find the test overall? Did you have any issues or have difficulties completing? If you have any suggestions on how we can improve the test, we'd love to hear them.
- The test was a fair test of my coding skills. It was a little tricky on some sections, but nonetheless, I enjoyed googling around and figuring things out.
